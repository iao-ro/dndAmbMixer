        <h3><div style="text-align:center;">This application has been developed by Ruraidh Oliphant, Julia Pawlik and Benjamin Viney.</div><br>
            Our inspiration was to create an application which can be used to create different soundscapes for roleplaying games such as D&D, to make the game more immersive.<br>
            We wanted the application to be able to be used by game masters to mix together different samples to make their worlds come to life.
            The basis of the application is a mixer that is preloaded with audio samples.<br>
            There is volume control on each channel as well as a solo and mute button for each channel. There is an EQ for each channel and all channels can be sent to a compressor, delay and reverb effect.
        </h3><br>
        <h3>
            How to use the mixer.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>From the top of the mixer select the audio source</li>
            <li>If eq is desired select from next menu, frequency and q can be adjusted by the sliders</li>
            <li>The output can then be selected: None, Master, Fx</li>
            <li>To adjust the pan use the pan knob below the output</li>
            <li>Finally the gain of the channel can be adjusted using the slider next to the meters</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            How to use Fx section
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If a channel has been sent to the Fx section just select an fx from the dropdown</li>
            <li>Controls for the fx selected should then appear</li>
            <li>Adjust to preference</li>
            <li>A second fx can be selected from the next drop down or ignored</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            How to use master section
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The play channel buttens can be used to fade sounds in and out</li>
            <li>Next to the master meter there is a master fader</li>
        </ol>
